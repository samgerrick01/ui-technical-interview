# React Todo App Interview Challenge

## üéØ Objective
Create a fully-featured Todo application using React that demonstrates your understanding of modern React development, state management, and UI/UX best practices.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Please do not use AI tools (like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) during this interview. This challenge is designed to assess your own coding abilities and problem-solving skills.**

## üîå Provided API Client

You will be provided with an `APIClient` class that handles all data operations for the todo application. This client abstracts away the complexity of making HTTP requests and provides a clean interface for CRUD operations.

### Basic Usage Examples:

```javascript
// Initialize the API client
const apiClient = new APIClient();

// Get all todos
const todos = await apiClient.getTodos();

// Create a new todo
const newTodo = await apiClient.createTodo({
  title: "Complete interview challenge",
  priority: "high",
  description: "This is an example TODO"
});

// Update a todo
const updatedTodo = await apiClient.updateTodo(todoId, {
  completed: true,
  priority: "medium"
});

// Delete a todo
await apiClient.deleteTodo(todoId);

// Get a single todo by ID
const todo = await apiClient.getTodo(todoId);
```

### Error Handling:
The API client will throw errors for failed requests, so make sure to implement proper error handling in your components.

### Note:
- All methods return Promises, so you'll need to use async/await or .then() syntax
- The client handles authentication and request formatting automatically
- Focus on building the UI and business logic - the API integration is already handled for you
